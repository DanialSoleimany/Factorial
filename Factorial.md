# Factorial
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of n also equals the product of n with the next smaller factorial:

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1 = n * (n-1)!
Ex.
5! = 5 * 4! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Notice that the value of 0! is 1.
